I love C for its raw speed (although it does have its drawbacks). We
should all write more C.

With this shell script, you can compile and execute C "scripts" in
one go!

(Oh yeah, and it works for C++ too).

![GIF Demo](http://i.imgur.com/aWnG03r.gif)

Here's a simple example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Run it by typing:
```bash
$ c hello.c
Hello World!
```

Or, call it from the shebang!
```c
#!/usr/bin/c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
```bash
$ chmod +x hello.c
$ ./hello.c
Hello World!
```

## Hooked? Here's how to install it:
Use a package manager? [Check here](https://github.com/ryanmjacobs/c#packages).

For all users:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ryanmjacobs/c
$ sudo cp ./c/c /usr/bin/c
```

Just for a local user:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ryanmjacobs/c
$ mkdir -p ~/.bin
$ cp ./c/c ~/.bin/c
$ echo 'PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Note: if you install it somewhere other than `/usr/bin/c`, then your shebang will be different.
For example it may be something more similar to `#!/home/ryan/.bin/c`.

## Okay, how do I use it?
c will use whatever $CC is set to. You can change this with:
```bash
$ export CC=clang
$ export CC=tcc
$ # etc...
```
## CLI
### Multiple Files - CLI
Anything you want passed to the compiler, put in quotes as the first argument.
Whether they're flags (`-Wall`, `-O2`, etc.) or file names (`file.c`,
`main.c`, etc.).

```bash
$ c "main.c other.c" arg1 arg2
$ c "main.c other.c -O3 -Wall -lncurses" arg1 arg2
```
### Single File - CLI
With only one file, omit the quotes:
```bash
$ c hello.c
$ c main.c arg1 arg2
```

## Shebang!
After adding a shebang, just set the file to executable and it's ready to run.
```bash
$ chmod +x file.c
$ ./file.c
```

### Single File - Shebang
Add this to the top of your C file:
```c
#!/usr/bin/c
```

### Multiple Files - Shebang
Just tack on any extra flags, options, or files you want passed to the compiler.
Then be sure to add the terminating `--` characters.
```c
#!/usr/bin/c file1.c file2.c -lncurses -lm --
```

## Compiling from stdin
```c
$ cat hello.c | c
# ...or...
$ c < hello.c
```
```c
$ c "" arg1 arg2 < hello.c
$ c "other.c -lncurses" arg1 arg2 < hello.c
```

# Contributing
Feel free to submit any ideas, questions, or problems by reporting an issue.
Or, if you're feeling bit brave, submit a pull request. :grimacing:

Just hack away and make sure that all of the tests pass.
```bash
$ cd tests
$ ./test.sh
```
